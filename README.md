- The executable should work for any Windows PC
- Basic controls are WASD to move and Space to jump
- Sorry that the tilesets and graphics in general look terrible. It's partly just what I had to work with, but also I didn't realize I'd need to scale the tilesets way up in an external image-editor until late enough in the project that it wasn't worth redoing everything
